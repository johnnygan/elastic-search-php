# elastic-search-php
Demo for Elastic Search PHP client
The demo was created by Laravel 4, and purpose is to show all Elastic Search in php function call.
Before you can run the demo program, you have to install Elastic Search on your server first. See how to install Elasticsearch at 
http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_installation.html

Next, you need to install Laravel framework, my code was created by laravel 4, I did not have time to test on Laravel 5. So try to install Laravel 4.2 first. Here is the documentation about how to install Laravel at
